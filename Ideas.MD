Necessary to modify the architecture?
- MongoDB takes care of atomic operations thus making sure the data stored is persistent and non corrupted.
- What we can do is to reduce the amount of request or delay them.
- In the current state of the project, nothing works if there is no MongoDB available, include fallbacks?
    - Temporarly store data in-memory and when the server is up, push the updates to it.
- Everything from server relies on the mongoose schema
TODO: 
- Mimic the structure of mongoose schemas and store the information of users in them in-memory.
    - Whenever a request comes in, we could use the data from memory.
        - Issues which could potentially follow with this approach
            - Consistency, Race conditions etc.
        - Some solutions we could test out are Operational Transformation, CRDT.
- Is it worth it though?
    - With such a huge modifications on the project, would bit be better to start from scratch?
    - Everything works as it should be, further optimilizations are probably possible without making big changes to the structure.
- Goals?
    - Do we want a realtime collborative feature?
    - With the current state, we will only update the users on a specific time(need verification).
    - Can we expand the project to react on change and update the users instantly or almost in real time?
