--------------------------
User Screen filter

Shows each student / group icon, name and allows Teacher to select (radio button) and view one of their screens.
Also show icon to reflect which question they are currently seeing.
Also allows 'select all' , (select none?)

Message filter

By default all participants selected, and all tags selected, (+ 'no tag' category)
Showing/hidding and/or tags participants only affects own screen (whether teacher or students) -> no persistance, no broadcast



### Messages
------------
(low priority) Define three max text length sizes
'pop open' when tapped?
show text countdown

#### Message editor
--
Should be of type "bottom sheet" (takes the full width of the screen as modal)
Dissmisses using click on the backdrop or swipe or message post


#### Message feed
--
Hamburger menu opens 3 options: "add to wall", "edit", "delete"

* "add to wall": the message remains 'orange' as long as it is on the wall (the message on wall remains white when added)
* "edit": opens the bottom sheet and places the text within
* "delete": removes the message from the wall and the feed and mark it as "deleted" (remains persisted in the DB)

#### Message 'label'
--
when clicking on the 'A' of a message, this turns the message into a label with a specific style. The functionality remains the same (copying, editing, deleting, etc)
